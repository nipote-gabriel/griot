# ðŸš€ GitHub Repository Setup

Your Wise & Otherwise game is ready to be pushed to GitHub! Here's how to create the repository:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account

2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right â†’ "New repository"

3. **Repository settings:**
   - Repository name: `wise-otherwise-game`
   - Description: `ðŸŽ­ Mobile-optimized Wise & Otherwise party game with pass-and-play and online multiplayer modes`
   - Visibility: **Public** (so others can play!)
   - **DON'T initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)

4. **Copy the repository URL** (it will look like: `https://github.com/yourusername/wise-otherwise-game.git`)

5. **Push your code** by running these commands:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/gabrielnipote/Cursor Test Project"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/wise-otherwise-game.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if you have it)

```bash
cd "/Users/gabrielnipote/Cursor Test Project"
gh repo create wise-otherwise-game --public --description "ðŸŽ­ Mobile-optimized Wise & Otherwise party game with pass-and-play and online multiplayer modes" --source . --push
```
