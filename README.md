# Griot

A super-minimal, mobile-optimized web app for playing the bluffing party game Griot (inspired by Wise & Otherwise) with friends on their phones.

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. **Start both client and server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open the game:**
   - Client runs on `http://localhost:5173`
   - Server runs on `ws://localhost:3001`

## How to Play

### Setup
- Players join by entering a nickname and picking an emoji avatar
- Create or join a lobby using a 3-digit code (000-999)
- Supports 2-8 players per lobby
- Choose between "Local" or "Remote" mode

### Game Flow
1. **Phrase Selection**: Reader picks from random phrase options
2. **Reading** (Local mode only): Reader reads the first half aloud
3. **Writing**: All writers submit creative endings for the phrase
4. **Reorder**: Reader arranges all answers (including the true one)
5. **Selections**: Players take turns picking what they think is the true answer
6. **Reveal**: Results are shown with scoring

### Scoring
- **+2 points**: Pick the true answer
- **+1 point per vote**: Someone picks your bluff
- **First to 10 points wins**
